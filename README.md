# 7DTD-Modlets
Modlets are organized by which version of the game they are for. Most of the mods are updated when a new version comes out. This readme details the modlets for the current version of 7 Days to Die which is: `Alpha 18`.

All modlets are free to use, but not distribute. Please leave the ModInfo.xml file intact.

**Finished mods have a "A18 - " prefix, works in progress don't.**

## Current Modlets
- **Ammo Stacks 3x**: Multiplies stack sizes for ammunition by 3x. 
- **Beaker Recipe**: Adds a crafting recipe for the beaker to the forge, unlocked at L3 of Yeah Science.
- **Better Forge Materials**: Adds recipes for converting forge materials into quick-smelt versions (100 units/s) and back to regular forge materials.
- **Better Silencers**: Further reduces the sound of silenced weapons. Much more of a "movie silencer" than a real silencer.
- **Better Starting Inventory**: I wanted a stronger start for nomadic playthroughs, so I added a starting bundle that gives the player a big head start and uses a different scenario for the beginning of the game other than you didn't "pay up" and got left for dead in the wild. If desired, a version using the entrenching tool (see below) instead of the usual pick/axe/shovel combo is provided.
- **Entrenching Tool**: Adds Iron and Steel entrenching tools. Functions as a pickaxe/fireaxe/shovel combo, with increased crafting costs compared to regular tools. Doesn't perform as well as the actual tool, but better than the wrong tool (e.g., worse than a pickaxe on metal, better than a fireaxe on metal).
- **Free Relays**: Makes the electrical relay cost 0W instead of 1W.
- **L6 Crafting**: Allows players to craft L6 versions of items given the relevant crafting skill is maxed.
- **Level Faster**: Increases skill points per level, reduces XP needed to level, reduces the rate at which XP requirements grow.
- **Money Stacks**: Increases stack size for coins, adds a "Compressed Coin" item and recipe for interconversion (10,000 coins -> 1 Compressed Coin).
- **No Boiled Water Dysentery**: Removes the chance for dysentery from boiled water.
- **Repair Wrench**: Adds the repair functionality to the wrench's secondary use (default: right-click).
- **Solar Crafting**: Allows the crafting of solar banks, solar cells, photovoltaic(PV) material, and the old electronic parts. Solar cell quality controlled by the 'Yeah Science!' perk. Only learnable from the schematic.
- **Two Extra 4x4 Seats**: Adds two seats to the back bumper of the 4x4.
- **Vehicles Enhanced**: Increases speed and fuel efficiency for the 4x4, gyro, and motorcycle. Adds an extra seat to the motorcycle, two extra seats to the gyro.
- **Weapon Damage 5x**: Multiplies all player (but not zombie) entity weapon damage by 5.

## Works in progress
- **Faster Gyro Reverse**: Trying to increase the gyrocopter's reverse speed when on the ground, to make maneuvering easier.
- **Vehicles Mods**: Adds mods for vehicles. Currently vehicles have slots for mods, but no vehicle mods are currently implemented. There seems to be issues with what passive_effects are implemented. This is currently a placeholder for when those features are implemented.
