# Extra Item Mods

## Mods
- **Backpack Frame**: Only installs in chest armor. Adds 6 unencumbered inventory slots (up to the normal maximum).
- **Improved/Advanced Insulation**: Increases the relevant insulation by 7(Improved) or 10(Advanced). Costs 2x to 3x as much as the base insulation mod. Individual schematics for each mod.
- **Long Fall Boots**: Only installs in boots. The basic version negates all fall damage. The improved version is more expensive but also keeps you from breaking your leg.
- **Military Plating**: Adds the military plating from A17 back into the game. Same stats and recipe.
- **Still Suit**: Only installs in chest armor. Basically a less-effective copy of the still suit from Dune. Reduces water loss over time by 40%.

## Items
- **Blunt**: Occupies the same slot as the cigar and the cigarette (face slot). Made from hops and plant fibers. Gives a 20% bonus to buying and selling.
