# ~~Adventure mod~~ Goto objectives are hardcoded to send you to traders. Adventure mod is completely unviable until this gets fixed.

## Overview
This is my attempt at creating a "story" for a group of players to play through so that there's something else to do with this game other than build a base, kill zombies, create elaborate death traps, get the best gear, smack zombies with your dick, create even more elaborate death traps, achieve ultimate cosmic power, ???, profit.

## Story
The current framing for this is you (and your friends) are a PMC or special forces who is sent in to retrieve a lead scientist from the aftermath of an accidental detonation of a new kind of neutron bomb. Instead of just killing everything living and leaving infrastructure and materials relatively intact, it did more damage than intended and turned everything into zombie versions of what they were. However, as you were flying to the landing zone your chopper lost power and started falling out of the sky for no apparent reason. You did notice one or two very tiny arcs of electricity on the instrument panel before the crash.

Upon waking up near the crash site, you check your watch and find out you've been unconscious for nearly a day. After collecting what gear survived the crash, you head out looking for a working radio to get the hell out of there and try again. 

## Requirements
