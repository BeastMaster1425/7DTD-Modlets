# Extra Item Mods

- **Improved/Advanced Insulation**: Increases the relevant insulation by 7(Improved) or 10(Advanced). Costs 2x to 3x as much as the base insulation mod. Individual schematics for each mod.
- **Military Plating**: Adds the military plating from A17 back into the game. Same stats and recipe.
- **Long Fall Boots**: Only installs in boots. The basic version negates all fall damage. The improved version is more expensive but also keeps you from breaking your leg.
