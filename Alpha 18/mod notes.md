# XML/XPATH IS CASE SENSITIVE!

## vehicle mods:
- aluminum gyro frame: two versions, one that increases speed and km/L, one that adds inventory space
- fuel efficiency mods for vehicles: increase km/L, decrease turbo speed

## extra item mods: (bold means done)
- **improved insulation mods**: adds 7, 10 cold/heat resist instead of 5. costs 2x,3x as much in materials
- **military plating mod**: bring back the A17 version, adds +3 to armor, crafted like other plating mods but uses military fiber
- **backpack frame**: only installs on chest armor, adds 4-6 inv slots (assuming pack mule isn't maxed)
- **long-fall boots**: like from portal, negates all fall damage
- **still suit**: only installs on chests armor, reduces water consumption rate (just like in Dune)
- animal detector(?): only installs in helmets, show animals on compass like the huntsman perk but doesn't require sneaking. Longer range than perk?
- zombie detector(?!): only installs in helmets, shows zombies instead of animals? can you even do this?
- diamond edge: installs in melee tools/weapons, adds a bunch of block damage and entity damage
- **obsidian edge**: installs in bladed melee tools/weapons, adds block/entity damage, but greatly reduces durability (obsidian is sharp as fuck, but fragile as shit)

## update UI mod with:
- elevation (helpful for flying, especially in fog/rain/snow)
body temp/outside temp
